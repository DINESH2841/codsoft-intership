## 📂 Projects

| # | Project Name | Description |
|--:|--------------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ | [🧮 Calculator with GUI](CALCULATOR%20with%20gui%20interface.py) | A simple calculator app with support for basic arithmetic operations using a neat GUI. |
| 2️⃣ | [📒 Contact Book](Contact%20Book%20with%20gui%20interface.py) | Add, search, and delete contacts. Data is saved in a local JSON file (`contacts.json`). |
| 3️⃣ | [🔐 Password Generator](PASSWORD%20GENERATOR%20using%20gui%20interfacing.py) | Instantly generate secure and random passwords with adjustable length and complexity. |
| 4️⃣ | [✊ Rock-Paper-Scissors Game](Rock-Paper-Scissors%20Game%20usingg%20gui%20inteface.py) | A GUI-based version of the classic RPS game against the computer. |
